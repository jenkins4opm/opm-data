/// This function will extract Zoltan's graph information
/// from the grid, and the wells and use it to partition the grid.
/// In case the global grid is available on all processes, it
/// will nevertheless only use the information on the root process
/// to partition it as Zoltan cannot identify this situation.
/// @param grid The grid to partition
/// @param eclipseState The eclipse state  to extract the well
///                     information from. If null wells will be neglected.
/// @paramm cc  The MPI communicator to use for the partitioning.
///             The will be partitioned among the partiticipating processes.
/// @param root The process number that holds the global grid.
/// @return A pair consisting of a vector that contains for each local cell of the grid the
///         the number of the process that owns it after repartitioning,
///         and a set of names of wells that should be defunct in a parallel
